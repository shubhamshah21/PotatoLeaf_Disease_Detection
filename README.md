# Potato Disease Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying potato leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify different types of diseases affecting potato plants.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of images of potato leaves categorized into different disease classes.
- Images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model performance.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Model
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to classify potato diseases.
- The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Training
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook potato_disease.ipynb
```

## Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Test images are used to check real-time classification.

## Usage
- Load the trained model.
- Provide an image of a potato leaf.
- The model predicts the disease category.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy using advanced architectures.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
